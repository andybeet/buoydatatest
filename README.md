The goal of `buoydata` is to easily download and process buoy data
hosted by [National Data Buoy Center](https://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/).

**Note: the [rnoaa](https://github.com/ropensci/rnoaa) package also has
functions to get buoy data. The difference is that (in
[rnoaa](https://github.com/ropensci/rnoaa)) only one years worth of data
can be downloaded at any time from a single buoy. As of 2023
[rnoaa](https://github.com/ropensci/rnoaa) is no longer officially
supported**

`buoydata` downloads all of the buoys data from ERDDAP. In addition the
lazily loaded station description data provided with the package
combines many more attributes (than
[rnoaa](https://github.com/ropensci/rnoaa)) by which to filter.

*Date of most recent data pull: 2025-11-04*

## Installation

``` r
pak::pak("NOAA-EDAB/buoydata")
```

## Data

All of the buoy data is pulled from the coastwatch
[ERDDAP]('https://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/') server. The data
set ID is = `cwwcNDBCMet`. The metadata for this data set can be found
at <https://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/tabledap/cwwcNDBCMet.html>.

The ERDDAP server retrieves and combines historic data and real-time
data from the [NDBC](https://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/) site. The data you
retrieve using this package will be ALL data from a particular buoy up
to the most recent measurement available.

To view the time series length available for all station visually (on an
interactive world map) see the `vignette("buoymap")`

If you observer a discrepancy between the data on the NDBC website and
what is available in this package, first check to see if it is available
on
[ERDDAP](https://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/tabledap/cwwcNDBCMet.html)
or use `get_buoy_data()` from this package. If it is not please contact
`erd.data at noaa.gov` otherwise create a data issue

## Reference

[Documentation](https://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/faq/measdes.shtml) of the
meteorological data can be found on the National Data Buoy Center
website
