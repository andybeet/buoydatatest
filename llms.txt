# buoydata

The goal of `buoydata` is to easily download and process buoy data
hosted by [National Data Buoy Center](https://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/).

**Note: the [rnoaa](https://github.com/ropensci/rnoaa) package also has
functions to get buoy data. The difference is that (in
[rnoaa](https://github.com/ropensci/rnoaa)) only one years worth of data
can be downloaded at any time from a single buoy. As of 2023
[rnoaa](https://github.com/ropensci/rnoaa) is no longer officially
supported**

`buoydata` downloads all of the buoys data from ERDDAP. In addition the
lazily loaded station description data provided with the package
combines many more attributes (than
[rnoaa](https://github.com/ropensci/rnoaa)) by which to filter.

*Date of most recent data pull: 2025-11-11*

## Installation

``` r
pak::pak("NOAA-EDAB/buoydata")
```

## Data

All of the buoy data is pulled from the coastwatch [ERDDAP](NA) server.
The data set ID is = `cwwcNDBCMet`. The metadata for this data set can
be found at
<https://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/tabledap/cwwcNDBCMet.html>.

The ERDDAP server retrieves and combines historic data and real-time
data from the [NDBC](https://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/) site. The data you
retrieve using this package will be ALL data from a particular buoy up
to the most recent measurement available.

To view the time series length available for all station visually (on an
interactive world map) see the
[`vignette("buoymap")`](https://noaa-edab.github.io/buoydata/articles/buoymap.md)

If you observer a discrepancy between the data on the NDBC website and
what is available in this package, first check to see if it is available
on
[ERDDAP](https://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/tabledap/cwwcNDBCMet.html)
or use
[`get_buoy_data()`](https://noaa-edab.github.io/buoydata/reference/get_buoy_data.md)
from this package. If it is not please contact `erd.data at noaa.gov`
otherwise create a data issue
